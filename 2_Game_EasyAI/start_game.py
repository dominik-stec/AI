    The GameOfTravel instruction:
    In given serial number of moves, the players can choose if go up or down in one move,
     but they always go forward too, the Human_Player try to hit in wall in last move
      and his moves should have this intent, AI_Player try to hit into free gates in his moves
      and avoid to hit in wall, in shortcut Human_Player try to hit in wall,
        the AI_PLayer try to hit in gates, they have the same number of moves in round,
        they have the same figure to move up or down, in game exist only one figure on map to move,
        if AI_Player in his last move hit into wall the Human_Player wins,
        if AI_Player in his last move pass into free gate the Human_Player loses,
